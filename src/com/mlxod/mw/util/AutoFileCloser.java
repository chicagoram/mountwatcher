/**
 * <p>
 * A nice little template-method-based class that handles proper file closing.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>
 * Callers subclass this class as an anonymous inner class, overriding the
 * doWork() method to do the actual work.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, if you wanted to copy lines from one file to another (note - not
 * an efficient implementation; just meant as an example of AutoFileCloser). You
 * would use code like the following inside any method:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * new AutoFileCloser() {
 * 	protected void doWork() throws Throwable {
 * 		FileReader fr = watch(new FileReader(&quot;foo.txt&quot;));
 * 		BufferedReader br = watch(new BufferedReader(fr));
 * 		FileWriter fw = watch(new FileWriter(&quot;fee.txt&quot;));
 * 		BufferedWriter bw = watch(new BufferedWriter(fw));
 * 		PrintWriter pw = watch(new PrintWriter(bw));
 * 		String line;
 * 		while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
 * 			pw.println(line);
 * 		}
 * 	}
 * };
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The AutoFileCloser constructor is a template method. It wraps a call to
 * doWork() in the appropriate try/catch/finally block for proper file close
 * handling.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The doWork() method is a hook - the subclass must implement it. Your doWork()
 * method calls one or two methods in AutoFileCloser:
 * </p>
 * <dl>
 * <dt><code>watch(Closeable)</code></dt>
 * <dd>Tells the AutoFileCloser to watch the specified stream/reader/writer. You
 * should call this on all nested streams/readers/writers as in the above
 * example. This allows the AutoFileCloser to try to close the nested
 * streams/readers/writers even if the wrapping streams/readers/writers failed
 * their close, trying its best to free up file system handles, socket streams,
 * etc. You should not do something like the following, as it will not allow the
 * AutoFileCloser to try to close the FileWriter if the PrintWriter close()
 * fails for some reason.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * // bad!!!
 * PrintWriter pw = watch(new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;...&quot;)));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </dd>
 * <dt><code>setResult(Object)</code></dt>
 * <dd>If your doWork() method needs to return a value, you can call setResult()
 * passing the value you want to return. The caller of the AutoFileCloser can
 * then ask for the result. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *        AutoFileCloser afc = new AutoFileCloser() {
 *            protected void doWork() throws Throwable {
 *                ...
 *                setResult("foo");
 *            }
 *        };
 *        System.out.println(afc.getResult());
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <h2>Exception handling in your code</h2>
 * <p>
 * AutoFileCloser wraps any exceptions that are thrown in a MultiException.
 * MultiException is an unchecked exception that has a list of causes. During
 * execution, your code can throw an exception, and the close attempts can also
 * throw exceptions. Your exception will be the root cause exception of the
 * MultiException. All exceptions (including yours) will be captured in the
 * "causes" list of MultiException.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can handle the exception using a try/catch at any level in the call chain
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * try {
 *     new AutoFileCloser() {
 *         ...
 *     };
 * } catch (MultiException e) {
 *     e.printStackTrace();  // includes first exception as cause
 *     for (Throwable t : e.getCauses()) { // all causes
 *         t.printStackTrace();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
